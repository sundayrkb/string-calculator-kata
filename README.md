# TDD Discipline

TDD Discipline: Commit after every Red, Green, and Refactor step to demonstrate the process clearly.

TDD’s iterative nature—red, green, refactor—using Kotlin’s modern syntax to appeal to its audience.
In Ruby, the process is identical

Ruby Explanation of The Three Laws of TDD

Ruby’s simplicity and testing ecosystem make it a natural fit for TDD.

The Three Laws in Ruby

First Law:
            Write a failing test before production code.
            You start by defining what you expect the code to do in a test.
            No implementation exists yet, so it fails.
Second Law:
            Write only enough test code to fail.
            Keep the test small—just enough to expose a missing feature or error (e.g., a method that doesn’t exist).
Third Law:
            Write just enough production code to pass.
            Implement the simplest solution to satisfy the test, avoiding over-engineering.
